# Ari's linux configuration files
Highly personalized config files I keep just to be able to clone to machines

Good luck using them as if they were ready to use configs
- I use colemak and didnt bother to add switching to qwerty
- I keep the configs even after i switch programs (sway, for eg)
- hi im johnny knoxville welcome to jackass

You `git clone https://github.com/aristosis/dots` (i also have these on https://git.gay i think lol), then you stow the files or copy them


## Story time
**Reference:** Current PC is a corporate HP tower. 5 year old quad core APU (Ryzen 3 2200G) and a SATA SSD. Snappy system with satisfactory visuals. I have a 1 terabyte HDD I mount at my home directory to store all my games and media. My only storage concerns are with packages because they always install on root.

I live in an Asian country where computers are not cheap. I grew up playing video games on an Optiplex 360 (DDR3 ram with a core 2 duo!!!). If I lose my computer, all my hobbies are basically fried! I was gifted my current PC, and quickly pushed it to its limits.
I started spending on upgrades, going from 4 to 8 to 16GB of ram. It was always far from just working.

I was saving up constantly for upgrades while I was on windows, and after W11, it became even worse. Until I switched to linux, broke it a few times, jumped from mint to fedora to manjaro and back, ending up on Arch after a lot of other distros and used the `archinstall` utility. Oh boy. Understanding linux, like trying to get the bare minimum install to be able to call someone on discord, stuff like that. I can possibly drag this computer *well into my college years*, very nice.
