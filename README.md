# Ari's linux configuration files
Highly personalized config files I keep just to be able to clone to machines

Not meant to be ready to use dotfiles!
- I use colemak and didnt bother to add qwerty support stuff
- I keep unused configs just in case I ever need to switch back
- My configuration is derived/lifted others over years
